# Sentences üìù


This application was created for practicing English grammar. The application was inspired by a book *[Grama To Nie Drama](https://altenberg.pl/arlena/)* written by Arlena Witt. I love this book but paper is not indestructible so that's why this application has been created. Available API represents only basic set of sentences.

<br />

for your own purpose you need to create firebase project and update firebase config in `src/config/firebase.js`.
