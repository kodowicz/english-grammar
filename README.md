# Sentences üìù

## Introduction
This application was created for better understanding English grammar. All sentences were taken from a book [Grama To Nie Drama](https://altenberg.pl/arlena/) written by Arlena Witt. I love this book but paper is not indestructible so that's why this application has been created. I want to share this app with people that also learn English using this book.
